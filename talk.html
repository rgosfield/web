            <h2>Favorite Romance Movie - 500 Days of Summer</h2>
            <p>My all time favorite romance movie is 500 Days of Summer. I found this movie to be incredibly enlightening despite it's light subject matter. Throughout the movie, we see a disjointed timeline of the loveable protagonists', Tom and Summer, tragic love story. Rather, un-love story, as the narrator clarifies in the opening scene. The movie ended up teaching me a lot about love and soulmates while still being witty, upbeat, and entertaining. It's starring two of my favorite actors, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel, who bring a rather mundane story to life and truly embody their respective characters. To this day, I still reccomend this movie to all of my friends, and find myself returning to it whenever I am in need of a bit of direction in life.

            <h2>Favorite Thriller - Pulp Fiction</h2>
            <p>Yes, I know it's basic. And yes, I know that you probably couldn't classify this movie as a thriller, and I know that Quentin Tarantino is probably not a good person. However, I cannot help myself, its utter suspense and unpredictability make this film one that demands to be watched time and time again. Aside from the great performances, the disjointed timeline (noting the common theme) always keeps you on your toes, and the dry humor is a delight to watch. I love the movie so much, I even made it my phone case!

            <h2>Favorite Comedy - This is Spinal Tap</h2>
            <p>
            This movie takes the cake for both favorite comedy and favorite movie of all time. It is a mockumentary made by and starring Christopher Guest, who has mastered his specific genre, and showcases his skill and humor in this laugh riot. A failing rock group goes on one final tour, which is of course full of drama, technical difficulties, and sticky situations. This movie is an 11/10, and ever since I first saw it at the ripe age of 10, I have been calling it my favorite movieâ€” which I doubt will ever change.
